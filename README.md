# Technical test

_this project is still under construction_

A set of exercices to learn about single responsability principles, dependency injection, the pattern strategy, and so on...
It is intended to be kept simple, don't over engineer

the scenarios are in the **scenarios** directory
you can implement all that in the same directory  
if you have difficulties you can inspect the hints

*if you're stuck, or you want to skip exercices you can change branch, and probably merge it in your current branch*
